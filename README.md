## Usage:
- Write all your confessions into the *confessions.txt/* file in the *input/* folder.
- Each confession must be in its own line with no ENTER inbetween. 
- Run the program from the root directory *uct_justconfessing/* with the command
```python3 src/Main.py```.
- All your confessions will be saved into the *output/* folder.

## Note:
Feel free to fork and add some of your own features if you wish to. A GUI version would be nice or have the option of uploading other confession files or so on. Possibilities are endless.
